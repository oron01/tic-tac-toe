I want to have two player icons at the bottom, lie the name
then a player icon, and when you hover it you see statistics pop
up automatically with an animation or maybe onclick idk

thats on the footer

and on the top i can put game options like start reset, etc
(Start(start new game) Reset(reset scores and players))

I can also edit and maybe create an animation for every time
a mark happens like, an animation for an x or a circle
