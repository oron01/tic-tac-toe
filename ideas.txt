I want to have two player icons at the bottom, lie the name
then a player icon, and when you hover it you see statistics pop
up automatically with an animation or maybe onclick idk

thats on the footer

and on the top i can put game options like start reset, etc
(Start(start new game) Reset(reset scores and players))

I can also edit and maybe create an animation for every time
a mark happens like, an animation for an x or a circle

I can consider (I think that is what i'd do), is instead of adding the stats
to hover on the pfps, to add a moving slider at each side that
would display the statistics and would look like a [] (narrow, tallish)
rectangle that would have an arrow inside, and would slide away
from the edge it sticks on with the statistics, and is collapsable.

maybe i can keep their hover for something funny like a random quote
or an audio generator
